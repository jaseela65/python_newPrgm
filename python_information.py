  1 , Difference between python2 and python3 ?

  python2

  #1 To store unicode string value you required to define them with 'u'.

  #2 value of global variable is change while using it inside for loop.

  #3 Xrange() function is used for iteration.

  #4 Function print is like - print "hello".

  #5 in case of exceptions , it should be enclosed in notations.


  python3

  #1 Default storing of string is unicode.

  #2 Value of variables never change.

  #3  newRange() , function is introduced to perform iterations.

  #4 Function print is like - print ("hello").

  #5 in case of exceptions , it should be enclosed in parenthesis.


  2,Difference between compiler and interpreter ?

   Compiler

  #1  Compiler works on the complete program at once and it takes the entire program as input.

  #2  Compiler generates intermediate code,called the object code or machine code.

  #3  Compiler executes conditional control statements and logical constructs faster than interpreter.

  #4  compiled programs take more memory because the entire project code has to remain in memory.

  #5  Errors are reported after the entire program is checked for syntatical and other errors.

   Interpreter

  #1 interpreter program work line by line . it takes one statement at a time as input.

  #2 interpreter does not generate intermediate object code  or machinecode.

  #3 interpreter execute a conditional statements at a much slower speed.

  #4 interpreter does not generate intermediate object code .As a result interpreted programs are more memory efficient.

  #5 Error is reported as soon as the first error is encountered.Rest of the program will not be checked untill the existing error is removed.


 3,Good Features of python programming language?

 #1 Easy to code and High level language.

 #2 Free and Open Source.

 #3 Object Oriented language.

 #4 GUI programming support.

 #5 Python is portable language.
 

 4, What is escape sequence ? Explain with example ?

 #1 Escape sequence is a sequence of characters that does not represent itself.

 #2 it is used inside a character or string literal.

 #3 it is composed of two or more characters starting with backslash.

  example: \n  represents new line.

           \b  represents back space.

           \t  represents  tab(horizontal)

           \v represents vertical
